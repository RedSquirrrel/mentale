                  Jane teller is a 16 year old girl, who has been depressed even before lockdown.
                  She has become more affected ever since the pandemic though. She finds it hard to
                  find motivation and sees nothing in the future. Her days are pretty much identical
                  most of the time. Sometimes she has a good day, which is rare. She isn't doing her
                  school work because she feels lost in all of it since there is so much and she's
                  struggling to send it to the school.

                  Jimmy Corbin is a 15 year old boy, who is also finding it hard to keep his sanity
                  during this global pandemic. He has became depressed during lockdown. He used to
                  be a happy teenager in school, going out with his friends and having fun, getting
                  good grades. When the lockdown started, he started struggling with scheduling his
                  day and started doing bad on online school as he was getting too much work, and
                  struggled to pay attention from home. His parents didn't know how to help him as
                  they weren't that technical.
